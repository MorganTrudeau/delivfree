          CANADA INC.'s software permits registered users to place orders
          directly from various restaurants and businesses. When such orders are
          made, the Restaurant or Business receiving the order notifies
          DELIVFREE CANADA INC. that the order has been received then DELIVFREE
          CANADA INC. notifies a DELIVFREE CANADA INC. independent delivery
          contractor that a delivery is available to which the DELIVFREE CANADA
          INC. platform facilitates the delivery fulfillment. DELIVFREE CANADA

              under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration.
              DELIVFREE CANADA INC. will not retaliate against CONTRACTOR for
              filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising
              rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of
              the National Labor Relations Act. Disputes between the parties

              Executive Order, are excluded from the coverage of this Mutual

              Agreement, CONTRACTOR and DELIVFREE CANADA INC. shall be deemed to
